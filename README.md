## Demonstration of the project with a multiplayer board game.

The system can handle web platform (Chrome), desktop (Windows), emulator (Android) and real phone (Android).

It can also handle iOs both mobile as well as desktop and Linux desktop.

The mobile versions (phone/tablet) can also have Unity 3D plugin with realtime animations and light effects!

The players communicate through socket connections and there is chat enabled.

# update
2022-06-04

Perfect on web and also mobile but not good UI for that will be better just that it works is cool!

The backend com. Unity To NodeJS is also good if say transmit images of play or so...

Merged to strict ES6 first then magically everything worked out like before Typescript!

I am happy but new things on horizon to tackle!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the setup looks like: web React(Redux, Thunk) with Flutter Plugin, Flutter with Bloc(soon) on all platforms same code, NodeJS express server with MongoDB database on Google Cloud.

Surpricingly the web version works equally good on both android(tested chrome and edge) and iphone(tested chrome and safari) also with unity 3d eliminating completely the need to compile to mobile platform!

# waiting for open source

Until system fully tested and tried out also with more applications.
I mean all obvious things I see needs working out.

The code presented is not the recent version which i develop on other repo until ready for open source.


# client_system

Generalized Frontend Client System

The purpose of this system is to create a effective frontend display and interaction system
using the framework of Google Flutter. 

The idea is simple: To make a system which saves all the repetetive tasks of application developement 
in a way that is easily maintainable and reusable to save valuable time and have good organization from the first code line.


## Flutter

The project is built using Flutter which in turn uses the dart programming language.

For C# programmers an intuitive analogy would bee:

C# is to dart as C++ is to C#
